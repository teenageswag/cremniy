## What is Cremniy?

**Cremniy** is an integrated environment for low-level development. Instead of keeping a HEX editor in one window, a disassembler in another, and a code editor in a third — all tools are combined and linked in a single convenient application.

**Designed for:**

- 🛠 System software developers
- 🔍 Reverse engineers
- 🔐 Cybersecurity specialists
- 📡 Embedded systems developers

## Why Cremniy?

Low-level development today means using a code editor, HEX editor, disassembler, debugger, all opened **in separate windows**.

You constantly **switch** between different windows, and the tools are **not linked** together.

#### **Cremniy solves this!**
- 🔘 Everything is in one place
- 🔗 All tools are connected
- 💻 Unified workflow

## Features

### Available now

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 📝 Code editor | Write and edit low-level code with syntax support |
| 🔢 HEX editor | Inspect and modify binary data at the byte level (patching) |
| 🔧 Disassembler | Decode machine instructions into readable assembly |

### Coming soon

## Build

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Minimum version |
|---|---|
| **CMake** | 3.16 |
| **Qt** | 6.8.2 |
| **C++ compiler** | C++17 support |

<details>

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. Install MinGW, CMake, Qt6-base via **MSYS2 terminal**:
```base
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qt6-base
```
3. Add MSYS2 package directory to PATH  
   MSYS2 packages are located in `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` by default.
